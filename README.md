# Movie Watchlist 🎬

A solo project built as part of a Scrimba course to practice front-end development skills. The goal is to create a responsive web app where users can search for movies, view details, and manage a personal watchlist — all using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## 🚀 Features (Planned)

- 🔍 Search for movies using the OMDb API
- 📄 View key movie details (title, year, poster, etc.)
- ➕ Add movies to your personal watchlist
- ➖ Remove movies from the watchlist
- 💾 Watchlist persists across sessions (planned with `localStorage`)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with custom styling + reset)
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) for movie data

---

## 🧪 Status

**Work in Progress**  
The base HTML structure is in place. Next steps include styling, layout, and mobile responsiveness. JavaScript functionality will be added after that.

---

## 📦 Getting Started

Once the app is functional, it will be available live via Netlify — no installation required.
